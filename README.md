# praxn-linktree
My first linktree looking profile.

## Kind of Declaration?...ahaha
The page is a modern and clean alternative to services like Linktree, giving you full control over the design and content. It is fully responsive and looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.
I tried linktree but we all know that it is freemium so I can't afford it(personally). But if any one wants this design he/ she can use this template(a suite of code basically).

## Features
Clean & Professional Design: A minimalist and modern aesthetic.

Customizable Links: Easily update the links, titles, and icons to match your needs.

Fully Responsive: Adapts perfectly to any screen size.

Lightweight: Built with a single HTML file and Tailwind CSS for fast loading times.

## How to Use
Clone or Download: Get a copy of this repository or download the zip file(it would be better).

## Step-1: Open the file
Edit index.html: Open the index.html file in a text editor.

## Step-2: Personal Changes
a) Change the profile picture URL.

b) Update your name and bio.

c) Customize the links to point to your own websites and social media profiles.

## IMPORTANT
Host with GitHub Pages: Follow the GitHub Pages instructions to publish your site for free.
After this, you can add this github repo to your any social media platform which allows url's.
